###Experience###

**Director of Technical Services, Axis41**<br />
_November 2009 – Present_

**Sr Web Developer, Axis41**<br />
_May 2008 – November 2009_

**Software Engineer, Assessments.com**<br />
_July 2007 – May 2008_<br />
Assessments.com is a fast growing company with great people working there. I work on a team with 3 other developers working with ASP, AJAX, CSS, Javascript and MSSQL. We create varying types of assessments mainly for government agencies such as jails and courts. The assessment tools that we built help courts and jails decide what to do with offenders such as how to best help them, if they are likely to re-offend and if they need to stay longer in jail. I work with multiple accounts at the same time on a daily basis facing tight deadlines constantly. It is a great environment and a lot of fun to work with different people all over the state.

**Sr. Web Developer, ContagiousNET**<br />
_July 2006 – June 2007_<br />
I was one of 2 senior developers in charge of new technologies and our core MVC framework on which we used to build many sites. I was a major contributor to the conceiving and building of the homegrown MVC framework that we used. My major responsibilities included building and maintaining portfolios of websites as well as conceiving and building new technologies to solve problems that we encountered. I worked a lot in PHP doing object orientated programming along with using MySQL and Subversion.

**IT Director, Supply Link**<br />
_July 2005 – July 2006_<br />
I was in charge of all IT in the company including running and maintaining the servers, managing the many domains, keeping all the computers up to date and running, and building new sites. I continued to add to and develop the company's many domains as well as the company's intranet site. I better integrated the company’s many domains that allowed the sites to take a higher workload that increased the company's capacity for doing business exponentially.

**Missionary, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints**<br />
_June 2003 – June 2005_<br />
While on a mission for the church I was called to work in the office and while there I was enlisted to create an extensive Microsoft Access Database that would track all activities in the mission and create custom reports. This program had to integrate with the current church system to prevent repetition of data entry and eliminate some error. I accomplished this through extensive use of VBA, Visual Basic, Microsoft Access, and database normalization.

**IT Director, Supply Link**<br />
_August 2002 – June 2003_<br />
I started this job doing only part time web development using some PHP but mainly HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create some web presence on some of the company's many domains. I eventually became in change of IT for the company running our own servers, extensively using PHP and MySQL, and managing projects. I created 3 websites that have a dynamic inventory and dynamic content all controlled by an intranet site that I built to track inventory, incoming shipments, potential bad shippers, remind vendors and customers of what we are buying and selling, and keeping all the company's information organized. As a result of these 3 websites and the intranet site the company saw a 75% growth in ability to handle more product and therefore gaining more revenue.

**Web Development, Precision Systems Engineering**<br />
