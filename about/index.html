<p>I am a long time web developer who is passionate not only about web development but programming in general. When I am not working on projects at work I am working on projects at home. I really enjoy figuring out problems and trying new technologies.</p>

<p>While most of my time is taken up by programming, I do try to fit in time to have other hobbies. I am really into collecting vinyl records and record players, it is the only physical media that I keep anymore. On top of that I have a passion for gadgets and love to keep up on the news about computers, smart-phones, and tablets to name a few. I also do try to give some of my time to my wife as she deserves it with all the time she lets me use on all of my hobbies and passions.</p>

<p>If you wish to contact me I can be found <a href="https://twitter.com/danielcbaldwin" target="_blank">on Twitter</a> or <a href="mailto:danielcbaldwin@gmail.com">on email</a>. You can also follow my projects <a href="https://github.com/danielcbaldwin" target="_blank">on Github</a>.</p>
