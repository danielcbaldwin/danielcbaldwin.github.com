##About Me##
<img src="/img/avatar_2.jpg" alt="Daniel Baldwin" width="200" id="avatar" />
I am a long time web developer who is passionate not only about web development but programming in general. When I am not working on projects at work I am working on projects at home. I really enjoy figuring out problems and trying new technologies. 

I also have an almost unhealthy love for gadgets. I love to keep up on news around tablets, smart-phones, and computer technology. I also love to try different gadgets and change phones more often than I probably should.
